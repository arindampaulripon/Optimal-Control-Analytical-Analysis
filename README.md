# Optimal-Control-Analytical-Analysis
Just run the code, you are allowed to set 6 symbols here and you can extend. 
Here, a system with 3 ODEs is preferable. If you have more please do some code. 
Run, Enter Symbols you need, enter Equations (System of Odes with Control Variables, Input the Objective Function, Get the Necessary and Suficient Proof for the existence of Optimal Control, Get the value of control analytically, get the adjoint system, get the Hamiltonian, Lagrangian.  )
